## Problem Statement:

<p>Identifying the customerâ€™s mindset on the product is the difficult one because many people will refuse to give a review. Furthermore, every customer's expectation of a product differs. Despite this, we are using a machine-learning algorithm to predict customer ratings. At the end of the project, the customer gets to know the general opinion on that product. For the seller, it will be helpful to identify the lagging part of that product.</p>

## Approach
<p>The main goal is to predict the  based on different factors available in the dataset.</p>
<pre> 
<li> Data Exploration     : I started exploring dataset using pandas,numpy,matplotlib and seaborn. </li>
<li> Data visualization   : Ploted graphs to get insights about dependend and independed variables. </li>
<li> Feature Engineering  :  Removed missing values and created new features as per insights.</li>
<li> Model Selection I    :  1. Tested all base models to check the base accuracy.
                             2. Also ploted residual plot to check whether a model is a good fit or not.</li>
<li> Model Selection II   :  Performed Hyperparameter tuning using gridsearchCV and randomizedSearchCV.</li>
<li> Pickle File          :  Selected model as per best accuracy and created pickle file using joblib .</li>
<li> Webpage & deployment :  Created a webform that takes all the necessary inputs from user and shows output.
                                After that I have deployed project on heroku and Microsoft Azure</li></pre>
